# Model Building 
  * First, I Stadarized the Data .
  * Second I split the data into train and tests sets with a test size of 20%. 
  * Third I used GridSearchCv to optain the best model. * Finally I evaluate my model. 
 
 * I found that Logistic reg return the best score 
 
 # Model performance 
  * Logistic regression : score = 0.7747747747747747
